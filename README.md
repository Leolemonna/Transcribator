# Transcibator openai-based
This app is developed to transcribe audio files <span style="color:red">**under 25 MB**</span>
## Getting Started
### Requirements:

If you try running main.py you will need pygame, pyperclip and keyboard installed. You dont need to install anything to run main.exe.

### How to use

1. Run main.exe file _or_ python file main.py.
2. Select audio file in the sideview
3. Type in a valid api key.
4. Press **all Submit** buttons and Transcribe button. (Order doesn't matter, you dont need to press reset api key as well)
5. It will transcribe the audio files selected and return the feedback creating new files with the same names as the audio files'. ðŸ˜„
<br/>You can also press ctrl+d if the input field is active(green) and it will clear it. This way you can easily erase api key entered with only two buttons.

#### <br/>Extra
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you want to switch api keys during usage you can write the new one (or use ctrl+v) **and** preset reset api key because if you don't it will use the previously submitted one.

## Ideas for the new versions
* make the ui just visually pleasing <- that's a hard one. ðŸ˜„
* add optional separation of the resulted trascript into different peoples' phrases. Basically speaking, if the resulting text is a dialogue, you could slice it into pieces of phrases according to the people who speak.
* be able to select text and ctrl+c it
* text (result) files preview. Before clicking Transcribe button you should be able to see the names of the result text files. _e.g. if you selected 1.mp3 and audio.mp3 it would say on the side: you will get 1.txt and audio.txt files as a result in your folder_
* being able to update the file list with a button, right now it does not update by itself
