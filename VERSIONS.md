# Versions:
v0.1 basic file loading and transcribing
<br/>
v0.2 change of the api key was made possible through the input field provided respectfully
<br/>
v0.2a added borders to buttons for visual look
<br/>
👍Now I can finally rest with version 3 complete -
v0.3 multi-thread transcribition and ui rendering, it hopefully solved the ui window freeze since now one of the threads will be waiting on the response from the openai server and other will render the window.
